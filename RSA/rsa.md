# RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms.

    * ✅ Full Form: `Rivest–Shamir–Adleman` (named after its inventors).
    * ✅ It is a public-key cryptosystem, meaning:
        * One key is public (used to encrypt)
        * One key is private (used to decrypt)

## 🔑 Key Idea of RSA

Encrypt with public key → decrypt with private key

This is different from AES (symmetric encryption), where same key is used for both.

## 📦 What RSA is Used For:

🔒 Encrypting small pieces of data (e.g., session keys)

🔐 Digital signatures (to verify who sent a message)

🛡️ SSL/TLS handshakes (e.g., when visiting an HTTPS website)

📩 Secure email (e.g., PGP, S/MIME)
