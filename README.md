cryptography

## Definition:

* [Repudiation]  - denial of the truth or validity of something.
* Non-reudiation - Can't deny

## Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

* `Symmetric` - uses same key to encrypt & decrypt data
    * [AES](AES/aes.md)
        * [GCM - Galois/Counter Mode](AES/Gcm.md)
* `Asymmetric` - uses public key to encrypt & private key to descrypt data
    * [RSA](RSA/rsa.md)
    * ECC

## Building blocks

* Cryptographic Hash Functions
* Message Authentication Code (MAC)
* Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
* [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](AES/aes.md)
* Block encryption operating models
* Authenticated encryption
* [RSA public key cryptosystem](RSA/rsa.md)
* Elliptic curve public key cryptosystem
* Diffie-Helman key exchange
* X.509 digital certificates
* Certificate authorities and public key infrastructure
